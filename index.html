            <h2>PROJECT 1: Pizza App Django</h2>
            <p>
              During my second year of college, I created a small pizza App using Django. It is a website where people
              may
              create accounts and log in. After logging in, users may place pizza orders and view prior orders, similar
              to a delivery app.
              This taught me how to work with backend applications, data, and Django itself.

            <h2>PROJECT 2: Custom Shell in C</h2>
            <p>
              This is a project that I completed in my second year in college. This project was very difficult because I
              had to learn how to properly work with C and develop a shell.
              It was very enjoyable because I had a great time creating my own shell and customising it for my linking.
              This seemed more fulfilling because I was interested in it and it was the
              first time I had to execute what I learnt in a genuine C programme, rather than making small ones.

            <h2>PROJECT 3: Custom Timtable</h2>
            <p>
              This project was very helpful during everyday use. I created this because, I didn't want to spend time searching for my time on the college website
              so I came up with an idea to just send the timetable to myself. Using the pushbullet API and app, I was able to connect the program to phone
              and I programmed it to send me a notification of my timetable for a certain everyday for 7 days at 6am.

            <h2>PROJECT 4: Custom game using Pygame</h2>
            <p>
              I enjoy playing games and I wanted to try creating a game of my own. Using pygame resources online I was able to create my first game which is based in space.
              The game is called Space Warz and it is a simple game where you control a spaceship and shoot down enemy ships.Despite the simple description, it was difficult to 
              implement and I had to learn a lot about pygame and how to create a game from scratch. It was a great learning experience and I learned more about keyframes, speed and velocity in games
              OOP designs, Inheritance etc.
